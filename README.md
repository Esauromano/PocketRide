# PocketRide 🚴‍♂️📱

**PocketRide** is an open-source Flutter app built for cyclists who live for the ride, not the screen. This app is perfect for MTB riders, road cyclists, and anyone who prefers to track their rides with their phone safely tucked away in a pocket or backpack.

Forget about maps and distractions—PocketRide quietly logs your rides and lets you export your data in GPX, TCX, or CSV formats. Keep your phone hidden, stay focused on the trail, and check your stats when the ride’s over. 📲🎉

## Features ✨

- **Distraction-Free Tracking**: Keep your phone out of sight while PocketRide tracks your route, speed, distance, and ride time. No maps, no nonsense. Just clean ride stats. 📏⏱️
- **Background Operation**: PocketRide works silently in the background, so you can keep your phone in your pocket or backpack while focusing on your ride. 🎒
- **Data Export**: When your ride’s done, export your GPS data in GPX, TCX, or CSV formats to use with apps like Strava, Garmin, or for your own analysis. 📤💻
- **Minimalist Design**: Less is more—no screens to look at during the ride, just raw data tracking. When you're done, flex those stats! 🚵‍♀️📊
